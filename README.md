# Gestion_Log

First ever coding project, made with C#, studying context.

Project made alone for my first year of BTS SIO (Brevet de Technicien Sup√©rieur, Services Informatique aux Organisations) at ORT Lyon.
Allows the user to choose how many files he wants to process (from a distant server) into a user friendly readable summary and insert into a DB log table.
Made from late January 2023 to early March 2023, 4 hours sessions every week.
